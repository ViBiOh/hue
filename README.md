A web interface for easily managing your Hue installation.

![](preview.png)

## Getting started

Golang binary is built with static link. You can download it directly from the [Github Release page](https://github.com/ViBiOh/hue/releases) or build it by yourself by cloning this repo and running `make`.

A Docker image is available for `amd64`, `arm` and `arm64` platforms on Docker Hub: [vibioh/hue](https://hub.docker.com/r/vibioh/hue/tags).

You can configure app by passing CLI args or environment variables (cf. [Usage](#usage) section). CLI override environment variables.

It's a single static binary with external html templates. No Javascript framework. HTTP and HTML have all we need. If you want to use binary directly, download the templates folder and configure it (cf. [Usage](#usage) section). The recommended way to use it is the Docker container.

You'll find a Kubernetes exemple in the [`infra/`](infra/) folder. It contains two ingresses : one for "same network access" and another, publicly available but with basic-auth.

### Get credentials from bridge

To connect to your bridge, you'll need credentials generated by Hue Bridge.

Get username for Hue API by browsing `http://192.168.1.10/debug/clip.html` and retrieve username credentials.

```
POST /api
Body: {"devicetype":"hue"}
```

### Using it

It's recommended to use the official Hue mobile app for setupping and configuring your devices. The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use web interface for controlling the lights.

When turning lights on, there are 3 availables states:

- `on`: 100% brightness in 5 seconds, to avoid eyes bleeding
- `half`: 50% brightness in 5 seconds, for some ambiance lighting
- `dimmed`: minimum brightness in 5 seconds, for very low light need

You can use this software to configure a subset of your Hue installation:

- Hue Tap buttons behaviors
- Hue Motion Sensor behaviors
- Schedule light on/off based on time

It also support some third-party devices that are compatible with the Hub, such a power-switch. In this case there is only two mode : on/off.

### Why ?

Most IoT devices and platforms are relying on applications installed on your smartphone. But if you're not alone at home, you have to share your credentials with others, which is a wrong security pattern.

This interface allows anybody who have access to manage lights. In a local network, with a properly configured firewall, anyone on the WiFi can turn off/on lights, from mobile-ready dark mode web interface.

The application is not a app or hub replacement, it uses the Hub's API and is not required to continue to use your existing remotes ou app like you already do.

### Metrics

The web service exposes two specifics metrics gathered from the motions sensors: the battery life and the temperature. They are available on the prometheus endpoint `/metrics` (cf. [Usage](#usage) section). It also exposes basic Golang and HTTP metrics.
